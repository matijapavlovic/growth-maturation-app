##  **Live App**

##  **Download Template**
The Excel input template is included in this repository:  
**➡️ g_mApp_template.xlsx**

##  **Overview**

This Shiny application allows coaches, practitioners, and sport scientists to:

- Calculate **maturity offset** using Mirwald (2002)  
- Estimate **Age at Peak Height Velocity (PHV)**  
- Estimate **Predicted Adult Height (PAH)** using Khamis–Roche  
- Visualize:
  - Growth curve over time  
  - % Predicted Adult Height zone  
  - Maturity offset position relative to PHV  
- Automatically generate **PDF reports**

Built entirely with **R, Shiny, ggplot2, tidyverse, plotly, and rmarkdown**.

---

##  **Methods Implemented**

### **Mirwald et al. (2002) — Maturity Offset**
Predicts years from PHV using anthropometric variables:

- Standing height  
- Sitting height  
- Body mass  
- Chronological age  

PHV age is calculated as:
PHV Age = Chronological Age − Maturity Offset


---

### **Khamis & Roche (1994) — Predicted Adult Height**
Estimates adult height **without skeletal age**, using:

- Child height  
- Child body mass  
- Mid-parent height  
- Age- and sex-specific proportional multipliers  

Best validated for children of **White/European ancestry** — less accurate for others.

---

##  **Visualizations in the App**

- **Height growth curve** with PHV marker  
- **% of Predicted Adult Height gauge**
- **Maturity offset bar**
- **Growth tempo** gauge (if multiple time points provided)

All visuals are optimized for dark mode and export cleanly into the PDF report.

---

##  **PDF Report Generation**

The app automatically generates a **professional PDF report** summarizing:

- Athlete information  
- Chronological & biological age  
- Offset and Age at PHV  
- % Predicted Adult Height  
- Growth curve  
- PHV zone chart  
- Maturity offset chart
